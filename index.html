                <h1>はじめに</h1>
                <p>SHIRO, the most important cat on the
                  blockchain, was born into a poor household
                  in Japan. But from the moment she opened
                  her eyes, it was clear that she was destined
                  for greatness. She had a fierce determination
                  in her gaze and a boundless curiosity that
                  drove her to explore the world around her.</p>
              </div>
              <div class = "col-lg-6">
                <h1>ページⅠ</h1>
                <p>Shiro's desire to see the outer world was
                  strong, and she knew that she had to find a
                  way to make her dreams a reality. She spent
                  every waking moment studying and learning
                  everything she could about space travel
                  and the cosmos. Her determination and
                  hard work paid off, and she was chosen to
                  be the first cat astronaut.</p>
              </div>
              <div class = "col-lg-6">
                <h1>ページ2</h1>
                <p>Shiro's journey into space was a historic
                  moment, and she made the most of it. She
                  was the first cat to ever leave the Earth's
                  atmosphere and see the vastness of the
                  universe from above. Her courage and
                  determination inspired millions of other cats,
                  and she became a symbol of hope and
                  perseverance for all.</p>
              </div>
              <div class = "col-lg-6">
                <h1>ページ2</h1>
                <p>Shiro's journey did not end with her return to
                  Earth, she used her newfound fame and
                  influence to promote the use of blockchain
                  technology. She saw technology as the key to a
                  better future for all. Her efforts helped to bring
                  blockchain to the mainstream, and she became
                  known as the "most important cat on the
                  blockchain." Shiro’s legacy lives on as her
                  pioneering spirit and determination continue to
                  inspire new generations of explorers and
                  innovators.</p>
